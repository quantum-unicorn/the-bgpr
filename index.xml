 Hi, my name is Keith.
I&amp;rsquo;m a medium size granite from the coast of Norway.
I was rescued by the BGPR on the 25th of June 2021. I&amp;rsquo;m very friendly to people and most other rocks but I don&amp;rsquo;t get along too well with pebbles.
I&amp;rsquo;m an inside rock and I love sitting on the windowsill with a view of the outside, watching the sun go up and down, up and down, endlessly up and down as the universe evolves and I stay forever unchanged&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We, the Boreal Geological Pet Rescue, are an organization founded in 2021. We dedicate ourselves to rescuing lonely and abandoned rocks from the wild and finding them a new, loving home.
Every rock deserves a second chance. That&amp;rsquo;s why we make each of our rescues a profile on our page with a beautiful photo and heartwarming description. So that you too can fall in love with these adorable mineral outcrops.</description>
